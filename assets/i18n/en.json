    "textoSection6Zona1": "The war against drug trafficking originated in the United States (USA) in the 70s condemned the consumption of plants and their derivatives with euphoric properties, in exchange for the misfortune of other countries. However, at present there is a strong anti-prohibitionist tendency which, paradoxically, has gained strength in this same country. An example of this has been the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana whose acceptance has been defined by popular vote in different US states. Thus, Cannabis has become an important source of job creation and taxes, making the states of Colorado and Washington a reference for countries that have taken up the challenge of Cannabis regulation, among these Colombia.",

Some of these plants have had direct participation in the armed conflict as one of the main sources of financing for illegal armed groups. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to develop educational strategies to show the benefits and potential of plants with therapeutic and nutritional properties, including <i>Cannabis</i>, and thus contribute to the wellbeing of the population, through the generation of jobs and decent health.",
